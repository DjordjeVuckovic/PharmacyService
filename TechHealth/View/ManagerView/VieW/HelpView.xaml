                    Rooms tab has the most funcionalities, but it actually isn't that complicated. There is a table that represents all rooms in a system. Below are buttons that 
                    do exactly what their names say. A form will be oppened by pressing them, except if it's a "Delete" or "Inventory" button. Be careful that some actions require a specific element from the table to be selected(after selection, buttons won't be disabled anymore,
                    as all actions will be doable).

                    Very similar to rooms tab, even with less actions. If you want to add a medicine, it status will be waiting, as doctor has to approve it first.
                    You can only delete and modify waiting, and rejected medicines. If you want to see why doctor has rejected your medicine, select a medicine with that status
                    and then press the "Reject reason" button.
